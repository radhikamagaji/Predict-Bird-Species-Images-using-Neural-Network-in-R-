# Predict bird species using Neural networks from images. 
## Abstract 
Image classification/recognition has proven to be considered a benchmark for modern methodologies in machine learning. It is easy for us humans to recognize sounds and images merely through our senses. However, in this study, the model attempts to classify 18 bird species using images obtained from the Xeno-Canto website by training separate deep neural networks. Two models were trained for image recognition, with one small and a large dataset giving us an accuracy of 97.66% and 86.40% accuracy, respectively. This research is beneficial to raising awareness of biodiversity lost to human activity. 

## Intro and Overview 
The goal of the report is to implement image classification models to predict bird species. ImageNet, a pre-trained network that consists of human-annotated images that help test algorithms, is used to build our image model. The supervised machine-learning algorithm's neural network is trained on human-labeled images.
