# Predict-Bird-Species-Images-using-Neural-Network-in-R-
The goal of the report is to implement image classification models to predict bird species. ImageNet, a pre-trained network that consists of human-annotated images that help test algorithms, is used to build our image model. The supervised machine-learning algorithm's neural network is trained on human-labeled images.
